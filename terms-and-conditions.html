				<p class="subtitle1">For clients utilising website development, website app app development, UI/UX design, digital marketing, social media marketing, product development, strategic consultancy or any other creative services provided by EastForte.</p>
				<p>The following terms of services relate to all creative services provided by EastForte (including external services such as website hosting, domain registration. Contractual agreements signed at project start indicates your agreement to these terms of service.</p>
				<h5 class="subtitle1">1. Website Hosting Payment Terms:</h5>
				<p>Billing for website hosting service will commence on creation, prior to development of a new website, web app or any other predefined creative service that requires hosting. On consultation and client approval and if a client has agreed to using any third-party hosting services, the agreement will state that hosting services are invoiced monthly, using the client’s billing card and billing address. Termination of Website Hosting Services with EastForte’s partners requires a 30-day written notification in advance, in order for us to cancel the contract with the provider.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">2. Payment Terms:</h5>
				<p>EastForte requires a minimum of 50% down payment on all creative services. Down payment is non-refundable, and down payment amount may be modified at our discretion. The final balance is due 15 days from completion of the project. A completed payment will ensure all technologies, documentation and source code are handed over in a timely fashion. Should a project span more than 30 days, customers may negotiate milestone-based payment terms, or incremental payments based on sprint style delivery. Please note all payment must be made in Korean Won (₩) to a Korean bank account registered to EastForte. </p>
 
				<h5 class="subtitle1">3. General Payment Terms:</h5>
				<p>Payment is due 15 days after the date of an invoice for all services. Accounts are in default if payment is not received 20 days after the invoice date. If customer pays by check that does not clear, the customer is immediately in default and subject to a returned check charge of $35. Accounts unpaid 60 days after date of invoice will be subject to service interruption. Such interruption does not relieve you from the obligation to pay the monthly charge. Accounts in default are subject to an interest charge of $5.00 or 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance, whichever is greater. If your state law does not allow an interest rate of 1.5% per month, the maximum allowable rate for your state will be charged. If you default, you agree to pay Iceberg its reasonable expenses, including attorney and collection agency fees, incurred in enforcing its rights under these Terms and Conditions.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">4. Content Responsibilities:</h5>
				<p>The customer is responsible for all content posted or stored on their web hosting space. Iceberg exercises no control over the content or information contained on the servers used for hosting. Iceberg will not be responsible for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages which may result from the use of this service by its customers or any other related or unrelated third parties. Iceberg is not responsible for backing up data or recovering data in case of loss on the customer’s behalf. There are no warranties expressed or implied for the services the Iceberg provides or the software used by the customer.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">5. Service Interruptions:</h5>
				<p>Iceberg is not responsible for interruptions of service beyond its control. This includes interruptions by its suppliers and natural disasters.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">6. Account Credentials:</h5>
				<p>The customer agrees to keep all user IDs and access codes/passwords confidential. Sharing of account information and passwords is strictly forbidden. If a customer believes that his user ID or password has been compromised, the customer agrees to contact Iceberg immediately via e-mail or telephone.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">7. Governing Laws</h5>
				<p>Our HQ is located in Seoul, South Korea. This agreement will be performed in and governed by the laws of the Korean Republic. Any claims or pending legal action arising out of this Agreement must be placed within one year. If any conditions of this agreement are violated, we reserve the right to discontinue our services. </p>
				<p>All claims, disputes, and controversies arising out of or in relation to the performance, interpretation, application, or enforcement of this agreement, including but not limited to breach thereof, shall be referred to mediation before, and as a condition precedent to, the initiation of any adjudicative action or proceeding, including arbitration.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">8. Third Party Networks</h5>
				<p>Any access to other networks connected to Eastforte’s network must comply with the rules appropriate for that other network. We are not liable for any issues, business loss or other discrepancies that may arise resulting from an error with pre-agreed third party solutions. </p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">9. Content use</h5>
				<p>All content and brand assets will be handed over upon completion of the project, or once payment has been made. We do not store or re-use brand assets, written content, source-code or any other type of information about our clients or projects we work on and all data is transferred to the owner as part of the sales agreement. </p>
				<p>All services provided by EastForte must comply with local Korean laws. The use, storage, or transfer of information or data that violates Korean law, is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, copyrighted or plagiarized material, racist or threatening material, material that is obscene, pornography, “adult only” content, or material protected by other statute.</p>
				<p>We do not allow customers to cut costs on service by requesting we use, purchase, download or install pirating unlicensed software, listing hacker programs.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">10. Adherence to Proposal</h5>
				<p>It is the responsibility of the customer to review in full all proposals for website or app development, website design, and or any other services provided by EastForte before signing off. Our processes are designed to safeguard you and give you full visibility on deliverables. In some cases, add-on feature requests may be requested. Should we feel like we cannot provide the services or we feel we do not have the required resources to complete your project add-ons to the high standards we adhere to, we reserve the right to refuse project add-ons or invoice appropriately to account for additional time and materials needed.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">11. Project Timeline</h5>
				<p>It is the responsibility of the customer to review the project timeline and adhere to the dates for deliverables on their part. Failure to meet deadlines imposed by Iceberg will result in delay of project, or risk putting the project on hold. Iceberg may invoice customer for additional resources should the delay of a project interrupt Iceberg’s workflow. Indefinite delay of a project may result in project termination, and a new development agreement must be reached prior to restarting the project. Down payments for services are non-refundable, and will not be returned to customer should a project be delayed or terminated as a result of the customer failing to adhere to project timeline.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">12. Website Copyright</h5>
				<p>The copyright on a bespoke website, or any tech build using our creative services will be sent to the customer or stakeholder on completion of project and provided the client has met the full payment terms. </p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">13. Completion and Access</h5>
				<p>A project is finalised when both parties are in full agreement. This would be when the full development cycle has ended and the scope of work has been reviewed, tested and approved. Before closing the project, all features and functionality are tested and signed off by the customer. Should a customer request more changes beyond the original agreement in the proposal, we may request additional fees at our discretion. All owned assets, content, access to technologies and source-code will be released at this stage, provided payment has been made for the completed services.</p>

				<h5 class="subtitle1">14. Termination/Cancellation Policy</h5>
				<p>EastForte requires a 30-day notice prior to canceling a website hosting account. For Business Website Solutions, where the cost of development is broken down into monthly payments rather than an upfront development charge, a one year minimum contract is required. If service is cancelled early, the final balance on remaining months of service is due. Two years of consecutive service must be paid for copyright release, or to receive a copy of your website files or an administrative login. Upon cancellation, you will be sent a bill with your final balance (up to 30 days after notification) after your cancel request. At the time of cancellation, all website files, email accounts, and e-mails will be deleted from our server; you are responsible for requesting a backup of these files should you need them for future use.</p>
